##Rationals about technologies
### Ember
Its trivially, but I would say that Ember.js is my prefered framework. Its made by engeneers for engeneers.
Core-developers use it in their own projects, so their decisions comes from the practical side.

### Ember-cli
CLI tool for Ember provides (almost) everithing, thay developer needs. Well organized development process with building on a fly and livereload.
Prepared infrastructure for writing and running tests. Support during deployment.

### LESS
Less provides more structured code and modularity. Also it allows to use bootstrap variables and mixins.

### Bootstrap
Well prepared tools for responsiveness  plus components and events. Additionally, it can be easily customized with LESS.
